Such territories and areas are often referred to as ‘ICCAs’.\n\nICCAs have three key characteristics:\n\n1. An indigenous people or local community has a close and profound relationship with its territory or area.\n2. Decisions about how to manage the territory or area are made primarily by the people or community.\n3. The people’s or community’s decisions and efforts lead to the conservation of biodiversity, ecological functions and associated cultural values, regardless of the primary objectives of management."

UNEP-WCMC manages information on ICCAs in order to demonstrate how important the contributions of indigenous peoples and local communities are for the conservation of our natural world. This information is stored in the global ICCA Registry (currently offline).\n\nThrough the the Mapeo Desktop app, you can provide information on the outer boundary and location of your ICCA, alongside information on its basic characteristics. No information will be sent to UNEP-WCMC until you decide to share it. If you would also like your ICCA to be online, you can contact us to discuss sharing a case study through the ICCA Registry website. This is an opportunity to provide more in-depth details, photos, and links to further information.\n\nContact us via email: mailto:iccaregistry@unep-wcmc.org\n\nWhen communities provide information to the ICCA Registry, they help the international community to appreciate the vital connection between indigenous peoples, local communities and biodiversity conservation. It also helps people around the world have an awareness of ICCAs when they make decisions. However, communities should also consider whether they might face challenges as a result of making their information public. More information on potential benefits, and important issues to consider, is available at http://www.iccaregistry.org/en/participate/benefits-and-considerations."

This peer-review process is in place to ensure that the information published in the databases is accurate.

The process is defined by the indigenous peoples and local communities involved, meaning that it works differently in different countries. If you would like to know whether a process has been developed in your country, please contact mailto:iccaregistry@unep-wcmc.org.
